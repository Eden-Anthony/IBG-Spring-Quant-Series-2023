    "We do **NOT** expect anyone to have mastered Python before the start the course since often the teaching in Python so far has been lacklustre and confusing. The team and I at IBG aim to help you understand Python effectively whilst also diving deeper into the realms of relatively more advanced topics e.g. functions and OOP and touching briefly on the Computer Science (CS) theory that drives some of the design decisions in Python. \n",

So, be sure that the next 7 weeks will be very entertaining!\n",

    "\n",
    "For this reason, computers are useful for some problems far beyond our abilities in some fields e.g. Maths where differential equations can't be solved by hand and need a computer to figure out a solution. More commonly, computers help you to connect with other *machines* on the internet so that you can buy items, control another piece of hardware and much more!\n",
    "\n",
    "As computers are driven by solid-state hardware, they're faster than any human could ever be. A lot of stock markets now run on computers where millions (and soon-to-be billions) of sales are made every second. In quantitative trading, being delayed by even a fraction of a millisecond could cost a firm millions so it's important to be as quick as possible and that's the power that computers bring to the table. \n",
    "\n",
    "More importantly... **it's fun** to learn programming! Yes, trying something new can be daunting whether that's programming or trying a new sport/hobby. However, provided that you have a good teacher/instructor that guides you through the weeds and the trees, you'll end up acclimatising to your new surroundings as soon as you're done with the course. \n",

    "To access an element of the list **in the computer**, we use the following (sort-of) formula with a zero-offset index:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (element at index) n = address + [n * sizeOfElement]\n",
    "\n",
    "Really, this is basically algebraic linear interpolation. First, we find the address where our list lives. Next, we work out the size of the list and with the knowledge of how much space the element occupies (i.e. `sizeOfElement`), we can work out how far down the block of memory we go down before we find the item that we need. \n",

    "\n",
