        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Memory in computer is stored first by providing a variable a specific vacancy in computer memory. Where this vacancy lives in the computer's vast memory is known as the memory _address_ (just like your home address in a massive city).\n",
        "\n",
        "What happens essentially is that each slot of memory holds **ONE** item of the list at a time and all the elements of the list live next door to each other in the computer - this is known as contiguous memory. \n",
        "\n",
        "To access an element of the list **in the computer**, we use the following (sort-of) formula with a zero-offset index:\n",
        "\n",
        "    (element at index) n = address + [n * sizeOfElement]\n",
        "\n",
        "Really, this is basically algebraic linear interpolation. First, we find the address where our list lives. Next, we work out the size of the list and with the knowledge of how much space the element occupies (i.e. `sizeOfElement`), we can work out how far down the block of memory we go down before we find the item that we need. \n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "However, with a zero-offset index, we'd instead do `3-0` (as our first element in the list lives at index `0`)... which is just `3`, hence not needing a subtraction in the first place.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can just quote the integer index of our element \"bread\" in the zero-offset index without actually needing to do any subtraction in the first place as anything subtracted by 0 is unchanged! \n",
